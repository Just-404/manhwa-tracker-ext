An extension for tracking the manhwas/mangas that I read on different websites.

It uses the anilist api to fetch some of the manhwa/manga data and Dexie to save the user's in an indexedDB

How to use:

1. Visit one of the pages where you can read your favorite manhwa/manga/comic, then press the extension
   button and most of the information will be automatically generated for the suer to edit/review.

2. When clicking save, the information will be automatically saved.

3. To see all the manhwas/mangas/comics that the user has saved, press the button that says 'Go to library' and
   the extension will open library.html.

4. In library.html is where all the saved manhwas/mangas/comics are shown and can be edited, deleted, etc.

5. To import/export, click in the menu button.
